# Customer Retention Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn, helping businesses identify which customers are likely to leave and enabling proactive retention strategies.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Built with Python and Jupyter Notebook
- Trained on historical customer data to detect churn patterns
- Uses models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Handles imbalanced data using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and feature encoding
- SMOTE for balancing imbalanced classes
- Model training, evaluation, and comparison
- Visualization of confusion matrices and performance metrics
- Exporting trained model using `pickle` for deployment

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
